@fifilaferg @andykurtzig @justanswer It was our fault for forgetting to cancel before auto billing. We canceled a few hours after the 1st bill of $53 popped up. Turns out, they keep your money AND you can't ask questions for the month you just paid in advance. They don't tell you that when you click on cancel. https://t.co/jbNlXHnCRV	California	0
@soalmila @justanswer Not only that, after you cancel, you can't ask questions for the rest of the month that you paid for. They don't tell you that before you hit cancel but they'll offer to e-mail the ToS afterward. Huge ripoff!	Ireland	0
@justanswer Thank you. Will do that.	texas	0

Used @justanswer for the first time after an attorney friend recommended it. Have to say I'm very impressed.	Germany	1
@justanswer Does your business model consist of giving  a trial subscription to people who don't read the fine print and then springing a $50 monthly fee? Please refund this $50 fee I was charged 6 days ago. Users beware!	India	0
@justanswer worst service ever, they deleted a easy question, next time I use Google again....	India	1
@Pookey258a2 @justanswer Same shit happened to me, I was trying to get a refund for my hotel stay for a funeral and they took advantage with misinformation.	Germany	1
@justanswer Definition of the world’s shittiest cash grabbing service. You specifically design your marketing ads to misinform people in the process of collecting a refund. Garbage company, mislead employees. Hope the owner chokes on the fattest dick🤌🏽 https://t.co/XcvRmfSl97	California	0

@justanswer It's very sad to know how companies like yours play with words to cheat people of hard earned money. $46 won't ruin me or make you a billionaire but just pray it helps to feed your family for next few days. 
Next time pls don't cheat people unless that's your actual profession.	texas	0
Asked a simple question on JustAnswer about poorly washing machine. Told charge would be £5. Have paid in total £80. Customer service a joke. Any else been swindled? @andykurtzig @justanswer	Germany	0
@justanswer If you have written in the first page or wherever it does not give you right to use our bank details for deliberate cheating. 
Have you informed anywhere that the bank details would be used for further auto subscription and would not require approval. You have basicay cheated us.	Ireland	0
@justanswer I had taken the 7 day trial but nowhere did I confirm the monthly subscription. You have without my consent and fraudulently used my debit card details to subscribe to your services. You should have the courtesy and shame to send a mail to approve the transaction.	India	1
@justanswer you people have fradulently charged my debit card with an amt of $46 for a subscription I did not approve niether by mail nor sms. People pls beware of such fraudsters. This company is fraudulently cheating people of hard earned money.	Germany	0
@justanswer Just Answer is a horrible company. I recently JA for legal advice for a $5 question and I thought I made sure I was not signed up for reoccurring charges but was just auto charged $60 and they won’t refund.  I chatted with customer service and they refuse to refund me	texas	1

@justanswer  total scam.. save your money and use google, their experts just copy/paste from the top search. Customer service is horrible and they won’t refund the auto renew membership even if it has never been used/wanted. 🤔	Florida	0

@gupshupblog @navahf @NeptuneMoon @PPCGreg @PPCKirk @justanswer Close-variants will soon tell you if you've overly segmented.

For some accounts/industries, they're awful. For many, they actually compliment performance just fine.

This is the interesting side of testing and you can always consolidate back down if you've overdone it.	India	0
@gupshupblog @NeptuneMoon @PPCGreg @PPCKirk @EdLeake @justanswer You don't need to bid on the variants (if you are, your negative work will be through the roof).

@navahf @NeptuneMoon @PPCGreg @PPCKirk @EdLeake I'm marketing for one of the category at @justanswer. So, yes there are possibility of close variants, as this is my first hand's on experience in this, so curios to see how it will go after launch 😁 #FingersCrossed	Germany	0

@Dean_Devlin @justanswer This specific instance it makes sense. But in general, I try not to actively post negative reviews. Only as a last resort. Too many factors especially when it comes to a small business. Often we expect a 2 person operation to have the same support of a T-Mobile. Sadly No! lol	Florida	1
@Dean_Devlin @justanswer I'm curious, if you had not been who you are, with the social media reach/following you have, would they have still have made things right? 🤔	India	1
@Dean_Devlin @justanswer I had to to do this with a mobile store. Not my carrier but in my neighborhood. USB C cable when they were still rare. Went bad under the warranty period. They said no return due to "wear" so I posted. District Manager called lol. Last resort. Post.	India	0
@Dean_Devlin @justanswer Good for you and glad you did take it public. It sucks that a lot of businesses that treat you crappy or try to rip you off only respond to possible public shame on Twitter....but glad it works to get the ball rolling.	India	0
@Dean_Devlin @justanswer That’s great!!!  I was curious if things got resolved.

(Word to the wise @justanswer, when interacting with customers, always treat people the way you would want to be treated. Got it?)	Germany	1
@Dean_Devlin @justanswer I’m glad this got ironed out for you, Dean. But you’re right about companies in general- when their reputations are tested publicly, they snap to when in fact, the quality control should always be their strongest foundation, no words said.	India	1
@Dean_Devlin @justanswer That’s the best thing now is instant gratification from pointing there bad things to the public. That catches their eye faster and better then an email.	Germany	1

@WriterRand @justanswer You’re missing the point! If the person doesn’t USE the service and contacts you the minute you Bill them, then you should refund them. By saying “read the page carefully” you’re simply a subscription trap and you don’t care about customers	texas	1
@Dean_Devlin @justanswer OMG I just recently caught them billing me $65 a month.... which had been going now for quite a while.
Fortunately, they refunded all charges but only after I pushed, &amp; pushed hard.  
they charge various amounts 45 ... 65.... 25...so people don’t notice. #scam	texas	0
