@fifilaferg @andykurtzig @justanswer It was our fault for forgetting to cancel before auto billing. We canceled a few hours after the 1st bill of $53 popped up. Turns out, they keep your money AND you can't ask questions for the month you just paid in advance. They don't tell you that when you click on cancel. https://t.co/jbNlXHnCRV	California	0
@soalmila @justanswer Not only that, after you cancel, you can't ask questions for the rest of the month that you paid for. They don't tell you that before you hit cancel but they'll offer to e-mail the ToS afterward. Huge ripoff!	Ireland	0

@justanswer Does your business model consist of giving  a trial subscription to people who don't read the fine print and then springing a $50 monthly fee? Please refund this $50 fee I was charged 6 days ago. Users beware!	India	0

@justanswer If you have written in the first page or wherever it does not give you right to use our bank details for deliberate cheating. 
Have you informed anywhere that the bank details would be used for further auto subscription and would not require approval. You have basicay cheated us.	Ireland	0
@justanswer I had taken the 7 day trial but nowhere did I confirm the monthly subscription. You have without my consent and fraudulently used my debit card details to subscribe to your services. You should have the courtesy and shame to send a mail to approve the transaction.	India	1

This is the interesting side of testing and you can always consolidate back down if you've overdone it.	India	0

@Dean_Devlin @justanswer This specific instance it makes sense. But in general, I try not to actively post negative reviews. Only as a last resort. Too many factors especially when it comes to a small business. Often we expect a 2 person operation to have the same support of a T-Mobile. Sadly No! lol	Florida	1
