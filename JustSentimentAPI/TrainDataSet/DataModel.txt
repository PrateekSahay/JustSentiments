@Dean_Devlin @justanswer I’m glad this got ironed out for you, Dean. But you’re right about companies in general- when their reputations are tested publicly, they snap to when in fact, the quality control should always be their strongest foundation, no words said.	India	1
@Dean_Devlin @justanswer That’s the best thing now is instant gratification from pointing there bad things to the public. That catches their eye faster and better then an email.	Germany	1

@WriterRand @justanswer You’re missing the point! If the person doesn’t USE the service and contacts you the minute you Bill them, then you should refund them. By saying “read the page carefully” you’re simply a subscription trap and you don’t care about customers	texas	1
@Dean_Devlin @justanswer OMG I just recently caught them billing me $65 a month.... which had been going now for quite a while.
Fortunately, they refunded all charges but only after I pushed, &amp; pushed hard.  
they charge various amounts 45 ... 65.... 25...so people don’t notice. #scam	texas	0
